= Ammitto China Sanctions Data Repository

== Purpose

This repository stores downloaded and processed sanctions data from the
People's Republic of China government sanctions announcements.

The data is maintained by the Ammitto project and used by the `ammitto` Ruby
gem for querying international sanctions information.

== Legal Basis

China maintains several sanctions and restricted entity lists:

* **不可靠实体清单 (Unreliable Entity List)** - Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM)
* **反制裁清单 (Anti-Sanctions List)** - Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA)
* **出口管制管控名单 (Export Control List)** - MOFCOM

These are implemented through the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law (2021) and
various ministerial regulations.

== Data Source

China maintains multiple sanctions lists:

.Unreliable Entity List (不可靠实体清单)
* **Authority**: Ministry of Commerce (商务部)
* **URL**: http://mofcom.gov.cn
* **Effects**: Import/export ban, investment ban

.Anti-Sanctions List (反制裁清单)
* **Authority**: Ministry of Foreign Affairs (外交部)
* **URL**: http://mfa.gov.cn
* **Effects**: Asset freeze, transaction ban, entry ban

.Export Control List (出口管制管控名单)

== Special Considerations

* **Format**: HTML announcements (not structured XML/JSON)
* **Language**: Chinese with English transliterations
* **Parsing**: Requires HTML extraction from official announcements
* **Encoding**: UTF-8 with Chinese characters

== Directory Descriptions

downloaded/:: Contains raw HTML pages downloaded from Chinese government
websites. Data must be parsed from official announcements.

processed/:: Contains individual YAML files, one per sanction entity.
Files are named using the pattern `{primary-name}-{index}.yaml` where
index ensures uniqueness for entities with similar names.

reference-docs/:: Contains reference documentation and translations.

update.log:: Log file tracking when data was last updated with timestamps.

== Updating Data

Data is automatically updated daily via GitHub Actions.

To manually update using the ammitto gem:

[source,shell]
----
# From the ammitto gem directory
bundle exec ruby exe/ammitto fetch cn --format yaml --output-dir ./processed
----

Or via the adapters repository:

[source,shell]
----
# From the adapters/ directory
ruby adapter.rb
----

== YAML Schema

Each processed YAML file follows the schema defined in
`ammitto/lib/ammitto/sources/cn/` using Lutaml::Model.

.Example YAML structure
[source,yaml]
----

  - "PRIMARY NAME (中文)"
  - "PRIMARY NAME (English)"
